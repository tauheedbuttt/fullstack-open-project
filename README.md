# Mobile Collection Manager

Welcome to Mobile Collection Manager â€” a full-stack, monorepo-based platform for automating and managing payment collection in housing societies, sectors, and property ownership contexts.

## ðŸš¦ Monorepo Structure & Technologies

**This project is organized as a monorepo using [NX](https://nx.dev)**, which provides advanced tooling for managing multiple applications and shared code under a single repository:

- **Monorepo Tooling:** [NX](https://nx.dev) (workspace orchestration, code sharing, dependency graph, generators)
- **Location of apps/packages:**  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;`/apps/dashboard` â€” Admin web dashboard  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;`/apps/mobile` â€” Rider mobile app  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;`/apps/backend` â€” Backend API  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;`/shared` â€” Shared TypeScript types, interfaces, and utilities

## ðŸ“– Project Purpose & Overview

Mobile Collection Manager enables:

- **Admins** to assign sectors, manage users, audit collections, and monitor real-time payment statuses.
- **Riders** to record collections, skip or partially collect (with reason logging), and follow assigned routes via a tailored mobile experience.
- **Owners** to track their individual payments and receipts.

Supports multiple payment methods (cash, card, skipped), robust audit trails, and flexible user roles (admin, rider, owner).

### Key Features

- Digital payment and receipt recording per property
- Skipping and partial collections with reason awareness
- Simple but thorough admin controls for assignments and allocation
- Detailed, auditable transaction history
- Responsive mobile application for field riders
- Secure, role-based authentication and access for all users

See [Project Documentation](./docs/USAGE.md) for advanced flow and usage.
