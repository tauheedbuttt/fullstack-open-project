## ðŸš¦ Monorepo Structure & Technologies

**This project is organized as a monorepo using [NX](https://nx.dev)**, which provides advanced tooling for managing multiple applications and shared code under a single repository:

- **Monorepo Tooling:** [NX](https://nx.dev) (workspace orchestration, code sharing, dependency graph, generators)
- **Location of apps/packages:**  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;`/apps/dashboard` â€” Admin web dashboard  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;`/apps/mobile` â€” Rider mobile app  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;`/apps/backend` â€” Backend API  
  &nbsp;&nbsp;`/shared` â€” Shared TypeScript types, interfaces, and utilities
